However, just like humans, they aren’t perfect either. An offensive machine like a predator drone, even if made to only attack the enemy, can still harm civilians.

                            <p class="regular-font">There are generally three different roles a machine can play in the military, offensive, defensive, and support. Figuring out what specific technologies should and shouldn’t exist is the first step to figuring out whether they should exist at all.</p>

                             <p class="regular-font">On the topic of offensive technologies, they shouldn’t exist at all. They are most capable of causing harm to civilian life, and shouldn’t be deployed against human enemies. It’s simply unethical to do so, because machines have no regard for the lives of those enemies they encounter. A regular, human soldier, is capable of making decisions that take responsibility for the enemy, which a machine simply cannot do. A machine being deployed into war is like using chemical weapons, it’s not something you can so easily stop, and it simply isn’t fair to use against humans.</p>

                            <p class="regular-font">Now defensive technologies, as the name suggests, are meant for defense, they are meant to protect something from an incoming attack force. These should have the option to be fully automated when protecting the lives of other humans, but for the most part, should only be partially automated. </p>

                            <p class="regular-font">Support Technologies cannot attack or defend, so they mainly include anything that can perform reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and supply runs. Since they do not cause any direct harm, they should be fully autonomous. They do what their human counterparts already do, but even better. While the information they can collect can cause harm, so can the humans, and the information that they can collect. In the end, the information they collect, should only be interpreted and used by humans.

In the end, these technologies should be used scarcely, only when absolutely necessary. In terms of the specifics, automated defenses should be used only when absolutely necessary, while support roles can be used quite often, since most of the time, it is definitely necessary. </p>
